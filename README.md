# ExposureBlend
Adobe Lightroom plugin:  select a bunch of images, and this will adjust all of the exposure levels between the first and last images selected.

Written for time lapse sequences, where you want to set the exposure correctly for the first and last images, and have the 
rest of the images slowly transition between those two exposure levels.
